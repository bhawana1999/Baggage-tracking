# Baggage-tracking

Summary of the Invention

An RFID tag is attached to the passenger's luggage at the time of check in. The attached tag's number is then linked with the unique travel id (PNR) in the local database, through a web app interface. The luggage is then tracked through various checkpoints using RFID readers. These readers are placed and positioned inside the airport, in such a manner that it enables tracking of previously untracked paths and addressing the existing system's vulnerabilities at certain specific spots. This improves the system's reliability. The passenger is given an option to track his/her luggage using a mobile application. The last checkpoint in the proposed system is a special purpose always open exit gate. It scans the RFID tag and matches the passenger identity with the luggage to ensure that the luggage is claimed by the rightful owner.
